// Imagine that calling the function Utils.calculateNumber is actually calling an API or a very expensive method. You donâ€™t necessarily want to do that on every test run

// Verify that the stub is being called with type = SUM, a = 100, and b = 20
// Add a spy to verify that console.log is logging the correct message The total is: 10
